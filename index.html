	<div><p style="float:right;">Frutiger Aero is the future of the past. It is a graphic design style which was most prominent from 2004 to around 2013. It defines many of the tech of our childhoods, and is a familiar yet long-gone face.</p>
	<p>The primary, identifying characteristic of Frutiger Aero is the union of technology and nature. It represents hope and harmony, and was meant to be welcoming towards newcomers to the world of technology.</p></div>

	<div><p>Iconic iterations of the Frutiger Aero design language can be found within the user interfaces of Windows 7, earlier versions of iOS, macOS, consoles such as the Wii, and more around that time range.</p>
	<p>In recent times, Gen Z's nostalgia towards Frutiger Aero has caused a resurgence in the aesthetic and style, as can be evidenced by the choices for the graphics of this single-page website.</p></div>
